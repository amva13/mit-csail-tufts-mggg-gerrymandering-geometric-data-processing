The package has been designed to make is easy for a python user to create, explore and modify graph objects that have been built from shape files. We have also *strongly encouraged* an architecture which will make it easy for new algorithms and methods to be included so that they're always easy for users to find. Let's get started\n",

We need to know the place you've stored your `.shp` file, the column of your shapefile to use to build a graph and the name of the algorithm you'd like to use. Here, we will use the included `TwoStepGraph` algorithm on example data in the testing directory."
